## 📌 Overview
This project develops a **comprehensive inventory and sales management system** for **Spare Spa**, a retail & wholesale spare parts business.  

The solution integrates **relational (MySQL)** and **NoSQL (MongoDB)** databases, with **Python analytics** and **visualizations**, to address:  
- 📦 Inventory tracking and optimization  
- 📑 Multi-channel order processing (in-store + online)  
- 💳 Payment flexibility (Cash, Zelle, Apple Pay, Credit/Debit)  
- 🚚 Delivery and purchase order tracking  
- 📊 Data-driven decision-making  

✅ **Impact**: Improved order accuracy, streamlined stock control, reduced stockouts/overstocking, and enhanced customer/supplier relationships.

## 🚀 Workflow & Architecture
1. **Data Modeling** 🏗️  
   - Designed **EER** and **UML** models to capture customers, orders, products, manufacturers, and payments.  

2. **Relational Model (MySQL)** 🗄️  
   - Built normalized schemas for **Customer, Sales_Order, Payment, Delivery, Product, Manufacturer**.  
   - Implemented SQL queries for customer insights, supplier relationships, and revenue analysis.  

3. **NoSQL Model (MongoDB)** 🌐  
   - Developed flexible queries for orders, deliveries, payments, and customer-order joins.  

4. **Python Integration** 🐍  
   - Connected MySQL to Python via PyMySQL.  
   - Generated analytics & plots:  
     - Orders by Product (bar chart)  
     - Top 5 Products by Stock (pie chart)  
     - Product Quantities in Orders (scatter plot)  

5. **Documentation & Reports** 📑  
   - Full methodology captured in PDFs for SQL, NoSQL, and Python implementations.
